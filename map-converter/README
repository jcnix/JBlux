This Python script is used to convert the black & white
"walk area" maps into a binary file that the server can
use when moving around Npcs.

The script uses PIL (Python Imaging Library) to determine
what color a given pixel is.  White pixels return a 1,
black pixels return a 0.  Since 1 and 0 are the only colors
that will be used, the script uses the 1s and 0s as bits in
a byte.  So I can fit 8 pixels into a byte, which helps
compress the memory requirements of the server.

Currently, this script only gives with every 4th pixel on
the x and y.  The only reason for this is to use less
memory on the server because these files would probably
be stored in RAM for fast access.  Because of this Npc
movement will be slightly inaccurate around walls and
other obstacles.
If memory usage is low enough, I may bump it up to every
other pixel or every pixel.
