This is the source code of what will become The Mushroom Universe Online.
A fan made Mario MMO.

To use the client, the server must be running.
The server uses port 4000.
The client is meant to be run as a Java Applet.

Use the official Sun JDK.  There is a bug with Slick and OpenJDK
where text will not be rendered.

Maps are made by using Tiled
<www.mapeditor.org>

Tiled is picky about how you do things.  Put your tileset .png where
it needs to be in the JBlux directory structure, and then save it as
a tsx file in the same directory.  Then save your map where it needs
to be.  I don't want to have to edit the file paths in every single
map.
