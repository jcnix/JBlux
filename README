This is the source code of what will become The Mushroom Universe Online.
A fan made Mario MMO.

To use the client, the server must be running.
The server uses port 4000.

****
If you want to run your own server, edit this file to point to your server:
jblux-common/src/com/jblux/common/ServerInfo.java
And rebuild the server and the client.

Also edit dist/db.conf to connect to your database.
The database will need to be PostgreSQL.  Preferably version 8.2 or newer.
****

The client is meant to be run as a Java Applet, so it should be signed.
You'll need to create a key to sign with, I'm not giving out mine. ;)
Change the key settings in the build.xmls.  I know that my keystore
password is in there, but I don't care if you know that.  I just won't
give out the key itself.

Use the official Sun JDK.  There is a bug with Slick and OpenJDK
where text will not be rendered.

Maps are made by using Tiled
<www.mapeditor.org>

Tiled is picky about how you do things.  Put your tileset .png where
it needs to be in the JBlux directory structure, and then save it as
a tsx file in the same directory.  Then save your map where it needs
to be.  I don't want to have to edit the file paths in every single
map.
