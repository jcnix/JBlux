JBlux Server README
*******************

This is a replacement for the original Java based server.  It was
created because the old server used too many resources, and C has
a much lower overhead to run.

The server requires these libraries:
pthreads
libpq (PostgreSQL)
libyajl (Yet Another JSON Library)
libcrypto (OpenSSL crypto)

To build, just run make.

To create the database tables, I use django (python web framework).
Just go to the jblux_django folder and run python manage.py syncdb.
I use django because I want to use information from the db on the site,
and the administration of information in the db is really nice with django.
